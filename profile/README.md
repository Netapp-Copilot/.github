## Hi there, welcome to CopoilotðŸ‘‹

## Getting started with Copilot
Copilot supports:
* JetBrain IDE's

## How to get access
Currently, we have very limited licenses for Copilot, so only specific teams currently have access to Copilot. Please reach out to your team lead to get access.

If your team does not have access to Copilot, send a request to ng-github-admins@netapp.com with the team name and the number of licenses you will need. Currently, there is no funding so additional licenses may need to be funded by your org.
